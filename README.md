# covid19
Basic data manipulation of COVID-19 data from April 25th

I based this analysis on a guided project on the W3schools website as I answered a few questions that were asked. The questions can be found at : https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/project/covid-19/index.php

The data used can be found here on GitHub :
